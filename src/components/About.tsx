          From my educational background, I designed, manufactured, and analyzed
          mechanical systems. During my journey, I stumbled across the field of
          robotics. At first, I thought it was cool to design and build the
          physical hardware (I still do), but what really peaked my interest was
          the software behind the autonomous behaviors.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          This interest has led me to develop autonomy software for robots that
          have traversed through land, air, and sea. Most of my contributions
          and expertise is in GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control). Lately,
          my focus has been more upstream where I get to be more involved with
          perception and mapping, and I hope to stay in this realm.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          I've been blessed to work with amazing people who I learned a lot from
          throughout my career. I want to share this knowledge in form of videos
          during my free time. Feel free to watch (hopefully) educational and
          entertaining videos here.
